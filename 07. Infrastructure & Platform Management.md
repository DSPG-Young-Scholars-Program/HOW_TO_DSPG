Development Platform Management

    * Hosted vs local 

We used Rivanna for 

   * computing sessions in RStudio, Jupyter, Visual Studio
   * data storage via pgadmin, our GUI interface and monitoring system that we use to access and view our PostgreSQL databases which store our regular and spatial data
   * project folders and repositories - code, data, plots/figures  
 
We used GitHub to document and integrate versions project folders/repositories between individuals on a given project team.


Platforms â€“
Candidate Applications (e.g., Workday)
- work with HR to set up application process?
- depends on whether participants are hired or students?
Communication (e.g., email, Teams/Skype/Slack)
- Teams/Skype: consider Teams/Skype integration with enterprise network? will program participants need enterprise credentials to access this functionality? do external stakeholders need access?
- Slack: consider 6 month/10k message limit for free version and cost for permanent version. Do you need ongoing storage of these conversations? Who will admin this platform?
Project Documentation (e.g., wiki, OneDrive/Teams/Sharepoint, network folder)
- Microsoft: wiki functionality through Teams, folder functionality through OneDrive/Teams/Sharepoint
Software Development (e.g., RStudio, Jupyter, GitHub)
- Anaconda-Jupyter/RStudio - open source, free to install locally
- GitHub - will free version suffice? 

Visualization Tools (e.g., Tableau, PowerBI, Gephi)

Teleconferencing (e.g., Zoom, Google Meeting, conference calls)
- what does your org have?
- office hours
- limits on # of visible meeting participants
- professional and/or branded meeting backgrounds
