Project Description Instructions
DSPG 2020 Project Description Instructions 

Please complete a one-page document addressing the elements below (and will be sent out in an email) to describe each project(s) that you volunteer to lead. Please send completed descriptions by May 6th to us. These descriptions will help us with the design (e.g., allocation of fellows/students.) and help the fellows and students with their project choices. 
Projects should be scaled to a level where a team of 2–3 students can make significant progress over 10 weeks, with good likelihood of arriving at some definitive result. Students will participate on 2 projects during the course of the summer program. 
Final list of projects (the lead, SDAD team, and DSPG team size), determined by Sallie in consultation with us, will be presented during an all SDAD meeting TBD. Decisions will be based on project scope and alignment to programmatic (funded projects and program development) priorities and skill sets of students. 
Leads will also prepare (2-3) slides and present to the students when they arrive. 

 

PROJECT ELEMENTS 

Project Sponsor/Collaborator (e.g., Arlington County Police Department). List the sponsoring organization and the individual point-of-contact(s) & titles.  
Proposed SDAD Team (i.e., faculty/postdoc), and external (non-SDAD) colleagues, if any. 
Project Description. Provide a more detailed description. This should not be lengthy, but it should address each of the following elements.  
Project Summary. Give a concise (1–2 sentence) summary of the DSPG project (i.e., the “question” or “challenge”). It could be a concise question (“How can our animal shelter adopt out more dogs?” “How should we best deploy medical workers to reach the vulnerable population?”) or an open-ended challenge (“Develop an algorithm to advise parents how to choose among camping programs according to personal preferences, income, and location.”)  

If this is part of a larger SDAD project, provide a 1-2 sentence of the overall project and the link between the two. 
Elaborate upon the question/challenge of the summer project. Delineate the scope as much as possible.  
Why is the project important to the sponsor/collaborator? 
Why is the project important to SDAD (e.g., potential funding)? 
What (if any) prior work has been done on this project? Are there existing data sets or papers/models that you will provide to the students? 
What are students expected to do in steps (e.g., literature review, data discovery, modeling)? 
What is the minimum number of students/fellows requested? Do the students require special skills (e.g., facility with a specific programming language or software platform; background in biology, economics, webscraping, etc.)?  
Expectations. Describe what you expect from a successful project. Beyond the final project poster and presentation, do you seek any other deliverable (e.g., annotated bibliography, draft paper)
