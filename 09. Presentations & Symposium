    * Is signoff needed from external groups prior to presentation? Data vendors/provider, project stakeholders, etc. If so, by what date?
    * What data products can be made available externally? Will these meet the data sharing agreements of the data vendor/provider? 
    
Presentation Materials

    * poster templates - use of powerpoint?
    * website/web app templates - use of Shiny and Rmarkdown (free, what are the limits?)
