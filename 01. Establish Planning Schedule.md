I. Establish Planning Schedule

Program scope - 
Project selection, scoping, requirements? 


Logistics: I’m also guessing for now we’re describing this as a remote program only, but otherwise I’d also add in something for facilities management (e.g., desks, meeting/lecture rooms), hardware (e.g., monitors), and life (e.g., room/board, transit options, etc). For remote logistics, there’s probably something to be said for taking timezones into consideration and how various platforms will interact.

Format: Also – do options for coursework/compensation need to be on the list? Meaning, universities would have to determine what format they’re offering for participation in the program and what amount of (if any) compensation could be offered?
