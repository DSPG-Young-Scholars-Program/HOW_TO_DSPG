## Project Presentations

Things to consider:

    * Is the use of stakeholder logos permitted/required? 
    * Is signoff needed from external groups prior to presentation? Data vendors/provider, project stakeholders, etc. If so, by what date?
    * What data products can be made available externally? Will these meet the data sharing agreements of the data vendor/provider? 
    
Presentation Materials

    * poster templates - use of powerpoint?
    * website/web app templates - use of Shiny and Rmarkdown (free, what are the limits?) 

## Symposium

   * Virtual/in person considerations (e.g., platform, meeting security, logistics of agenda)
       * last minute posting of links + passwords 
   * Speakers
   * Media team (e.g., branding, programs/flyers, marketing, blogs/interviews/writeups)
